Terraform locks the state of the workspace and only a single operation can be performed at a time. Developers may wish to break up large deployments into multiple directories and workspaces to operate on different parts of the deployments simultaneously. For example: User enclaves may be broken out so developers can perform actions on other parts of a network without (potentially) waiting a long time to redeploy user machines.</p> <p>The workspace view allows users to see a table with all the runs that have been planned and applied within that directory. Runs highlighted in red are destroyed operations.</p> <p>Within the workspace view users can click <code>Destroy</code> to destroy live Terraform applications.</p> <p>This infrastructure as code approach is different than many developers may be used to. The general approach here is to define a configuration and apply it in its entirety, rather than selecting individual pieces to be deployed. There are some ways to target individual pieces of a configuration, but they are recommended by Terraform to be the exception rather than the rule and are not yet fully implemented in Caster.</p> <p>Taint</p> <p>Taint is a flag on a resource that tells Terraform to destroy and recreate a new instance on the next plan-and-apply cycle.</p> <p>Taint allows users to redeploy resources. For example, if a user needs to redeploy a series of virtual machines, the user can:</p> <ol> <li>Taint these resources</li> <li>Run another plan-and-apply cycle that will redeploy the instance as if it was new from a template</li> </ol> <p>Some resources can't be tainted, however.</p> <p>Users can taint resources within the workspace view. Once a resource is tainted it will display in red shading. Users can also easily access the <code>Untaint</code> command while in workspace view before running another plan-and-apply cycle if they change their mind and decide to keep the resource.</p>"},{"location":"caster/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>Designer: a graphical user interface for creating and editing terraform deployments through the use of modules</p> <p>Directory: the outline of a project and the modules it contains</p> <p>File: text files that will eventually be put onto a file system and used with the Terraform command line tool</p> <p>Host: consists of a name, datastore, and maximum number of virtual machines that it can support</p> <p>Module: a container for multiple resources that are used together.

A common example of an app used in Player is the Mattermost messaging platform.</p> <p>App Template: The settings associated with an app that is added to a team's View.  An app template can be created for common apps that are added to a view with default settings that an administrator can override if needed.</p> <p>Authentication: Player uses IdentityServer 4 to authenticate users. Authentication gets a user into Player. However, to determine what a user can open and/or edit within Player, administrators need to set the required permissions within the Player Administration View under the Users Administrator tab.</p> <p>Focused Application Panel: The focused app panel displays the selected application in an iFrame. The iFrame points to the URL specified by the application template. The application within the focused app panel is responsible for authentication and content. Player displays content but has no control of the application running within the focused app panel.</p> <p>Notification: A message sent to a specific user, team, or view from an Administrator or an app that has been given permission.</p> <p>Permission: A key/value pair that can be created and used by any application given permission within the system. A permission can be assigned to a user or a team. Some permissions such as <code>SystemAdmin</code> are read-only. <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>SystemAdmin</code> are permanent permissions that cannot be edited or deleted.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions that can be grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged in users who are associated with a view. Each team can be configured to view a particular set of applications and be granted team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: A user who is identified in an Identity Server configured for the Player system is automatically added into Player upon the first login. In addition, users can be pre-loaded into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>Note: IdentityServer4 is an OAuth 2.0 framework that is used by the Software Engineering Institute to authenticate users. Some Identity servers are configured to authenticate using CAC cards while others are user/password based - depending upon the location of the system.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view. A view can be edited, cloned, and deleted.</p> <p>Views: The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation.

Hidden questions do not appear when playing in TopoMojo or via Gameboard.</p> <p>Grader: Select the grading type here. The Grader determines if players submitted the correct answer to a question. Select one of four types:</p> <ul> <li><code>Match</code>: The submission must exactly match what is in the Answer field. Use this when there is exactly one possible answer to a question.</li> <li><code>MatchAny</code>: The submission must match one of the pipe-delimited answers in the Answer field. Use this when there is more than one possible answer to a question.</li> <li><code>MatchAll</code>: The submission must match all of the pipe-delimited answers in the Answer field. Use this when a list of answers to a question is expected.</li> <li><code>MatchAlpha</code>: The submission must exactly match what is in the Answer field after all non-alphanumeric characters are removed. This is useful if the user might submit symbols that don't affect the validity of an answer. For example, <code>C:/Users</code> and <code>C:\\Users</code> are both valid answers and the symbols (<code>/</code> vs <code>\\</code>) don't matter.</li> </ul> <p>All four graders are case-insensitive, meaning that all answers and submissions are converted to lower-case by the grader before the submission is compared to the expected answer in all grader types.</p>"},{"location":"topomojo/challenge/#weight","title":"Weight","text":"<p>Weight is the percentage of total for this question.
